# vConnect
A simple script to connect to your v2ray connection in linux
## How to connect


 1. Download the latest v2fly release from the [main repository](https://github.com/v2fly/v2ray-core/releases/download/v5.1.0/v2ray-linux-64.zip).
 2. Extract the zip file in your system, I consider the extracted path is [PATH] 
 3. Create the file connections.txt and add your v2ray url to it (you can multiple v2ray configurations in each line but the only the first configuration will be used in the script).
 4. Run the script and paste the [PATH] in the terminal.
